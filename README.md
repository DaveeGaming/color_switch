# This game was made for the Summer Jam 2024.
## Small description:

Color switch is a top-down shooter about switching between opposite colors to get to further and further waves.
Switching colors changes the behaviour of enemies, so watch out when switching too close to them!

## Gameplay loop:

Getting hit by attacks, or getting rammed by enemies have different meaning based on your, and their color! If you get hit by a bullet which is the same color as you, you heal instead of taking damage.
Enemies:

Small colored enemies:

> They ram into you. If you are the same color as them, you heal. If not, you take damage.

Towers:

> Static enemies that shoot out circles, you must change to the same color as them to dodge it.

Circles:

> They either try to shoot at you, or ram into you, depending on your color! You can heal from their bullets too!

## Controls:

W A S D  to move your character

F or J to shoot at the direction you are facing. The shoot direction stays the same until you let it go and fire again.

SPACE to switch between colors
